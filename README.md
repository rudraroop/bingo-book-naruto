#### Will be replacing this with an actual website link when I get around to deploying it.


Disclaimer: This is a stupid project, made for practice purposes only. 

Made using ReactJS (Functional Components, Hooks, React Context), Express JS, Stripe payments and this Naruto API - https://github.com/andre802/naruto-api

Special Thanks to this Traversy Media video for teaching me how to use Stripe payments - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8M-YVY76O8&ab_channel=TraversyMedia

The bingo book is an overlooked entity in the Naruto Universe. Shinobi who work within Intel-core departments (such as the Anbu black ops) would create Bingo Books as handbooks for battle.

The bingo book contains entries about formidable enemies one might encounter in the battlefield. Their background, how they look, what special jutsu they use, etc. These are critical pieces of information that could save your life on the battlefield.

We have found a way to monetize this. 

This is the bingo book store - an e-commerce app for mercenary shinobis. You can purchase a bingo book containing information about any Kage or Jonin level Shinobi you chooose, provided you can pay for the same.

To make this code functional on your local system, make sure you view the last 10 or so minutes of the traversy media video

This will help you generate your own Stripe API Key and Product Keys which you will need to use in /server.js and /store/src/pages/Cart.js respectively
